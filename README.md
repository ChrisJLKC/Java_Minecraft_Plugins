# Java_Minecraft_Plugins
Plugins for Minecraft  server using spigot and BuildTools 

In these project files, you will find plugins that can be exported from Java to a JAR file and can be used with spigot, but if you want to add it into the plugins folder within the server, you will need to download the BuildTools JAR file. These projects are examples of what you can do with spigot.

JAR plugin files are provided in the plugins folder

Most of these come from here, few changes here and there and a good base on how to do spigot plugins, link is below:
